# Co-localization-Frank-Wolfe Algorithm
Implementation of the paper Efficient Image and Video Co-localization with Frank-Wolfe Algorithm, https://ai.stanford.edu/~kdtang/papers/eccv14-vidcoloc.pdf 

In improved_co_localization.ipynb you will find an update of the orginal algorithm enabling to build a one shot detector accross various images.
